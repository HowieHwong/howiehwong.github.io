## About Me

I'm a first-year PhD student in [MINE Lab](https://mine-lab-nd.github.io/) of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) starting Fall 2024, supervised by [Prof. Xiangliang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BhRJe4wAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/) in 2024. Previously, I was a visiting student under the guidance of [Prof. Lichao Sun](https://lichao-sun.github.io/). This experience was enhanced by mentorship from [Prof. Philip S. Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D0lL1r0AAAAJ&hl=en). Earlier before, I worked under [Prof. Tang Jie](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) and [Dr. Xiao Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=VKI8EhUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Tsinghua University.

## Research Interests

My research is centered on three pivotal questions:

- **How can we deepen our understanding of the trustworthiness of foundational generative models?** This line of inquiry seeks to develop robust frameworks for evaluating trustworthiness and to identify strategies for enhancing the trustworthiness of these models within specific application domains. This includes: [TrustLLM (ICML'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05561), [LLM-as-a-Coauthor (NAACL'24)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-naacl.29/), [Attack LLM Judge (ACM CCS'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17710), [FakeGPT (WWW'24)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589335.3651509), [Multilingual Alignment (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14721), [HonestLLM (NeurIPS'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00380), [TrustNLP@NAACL'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16686), and [ObscurePrompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13662), [Bias of LLM Judge (ICLR'25)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3GTtZFiajM).

- **Is there a superior approach to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?** This research emphasizes data-centric methods to enable scalable model alignment and evolution, ensuring that they adhere to human values and ethical paradigms throughout the development process. This includes: [AlignBench (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18743), [Multilingual Alignment (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14721), and [DataGen (ICLR'25)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=F5R0lG74Tu), [Interleave Generation (ICLR'25)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rDLgnYLM5b).

- **To what extent can current AI technologies effectively benefit downstream applications?** This research area critically assesses the practical impact of generative models, with a particular focus on their application and AI4Science, exploring its transformative potential and interdisciplinary contributions in fields such as agentic models, social sciences, and beyond. This includes: [MetaTool (ICLR'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03128), [PsychometricBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17675), and [GUI-World (ICLR'25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10819).
